  <h1>What is Holistic Marketing?</h1>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>
      Holistic marketing is an approach that considers the entire business and all its parts as a unified whole, rather than focusing on individual components in isolation. It integrates all aspects of marketing communication, strategy, and operations to ensure that every part of the organization is working toward a common goal and delivering a consistent message to customers.
